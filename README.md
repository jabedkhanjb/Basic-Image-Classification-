Basic Image Classification

<img src = "image/1_1.png">

Now, we will build a neural network model to solve a basic image classification problem.  We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

    Understand the problem statement

    Understand the dataset

    Encode the labels

    Understand neural networks

    Preprocess image examples

    Create a neural network model

    Train the model to fit the dataset

    Evaluate the model

    Visualize the predictions
